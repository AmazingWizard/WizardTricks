>“there was an exercise in Texas called Jade Helm 15 that Russian bots and the American alt-right media convinced most, many Texans was an Obama plan to round up political dissidents. At that point, I think they made the decision ‘We’re going to play in the electoral process.”

>The conspiracy theory reached peak hysteria during that same month, when Abbott ordered the Texas State Guard to “monitor” the USASOC training exercise, a move which some criticized as legitimizing a baseless and potentially harmful set of rumors:

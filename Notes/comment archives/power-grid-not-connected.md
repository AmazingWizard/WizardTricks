More on this: there’s a study out now called SEAMS which proposes connecting the 2 halves. It got shut down briefly by the Trump admin *because would make the grid more efficient* and less reliant on coal. The Atlantic did a piece on it here: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/how-trump-appointees-short-circuited-grid-modernization/615433/ 

TL;DR: solar is mostly active on the west coast and only during daylight, wind is generally more active in the evening on the east coast. Without both in the same grid the grid operate on a 12/12 hour on/off cycle for renewable energy. Coal is pretty much the best option if we only want to operate the generator for 12 hours therefore we operate on coal in the evenings in the west coast and during the day on the east coast. If we fill in the gaps we’ll just shift generating responsibilities and pipe in electricity every day. (An oversimplification but still)
